Binary search scripts are two different styles of achieving the same task. To use the script, you need to provide a sorted list of numbers separated by spaces when prompted. 
Then, you need to enter the number you want to search for within the list. 
The script will output the index of the target number if it is found, otherwise, it will indicate that the number is not in the list.
You can decide which search is fastest given your circumstances.
